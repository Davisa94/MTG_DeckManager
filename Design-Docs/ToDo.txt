A list of things to be done on the project:

TODO: After app works by polling aapi for card data everytime, cache card data by storing values for cards in card model
OPTION:
1: We can have a listitem that describes how many copies of a card exist in teh deck and constrain the 4 card copy there
2: we have a list of the cards and allow duplicates in the list up to four times, will get expensive for larger decksizes or card lists
With performance considerations, having a list of list items may have better performance implications and therefore option 1 is chosen.
ISSUE:
We need to have a card model for caching card info and we need a Card model for storing a card to a deck
SOLUTION:
Store the card to deck relational info in Card and the cached card info in CardInfo
TODO: when searching for a card first check the CardInfo Table for the card the ntry checking the external API

TODO: Create Serializers for Deck

{% comment %} 
We are revamping the project to be a card searcher with caching instead

TODO: Add more card info fields to the card model
TODO: Add nickname field to the card field
